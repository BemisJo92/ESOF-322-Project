Team Members Names: Logan Davis, Joel Lechman, John Bemis, Ian Hecker

A couple things that gave us trouble is first, using Git commands was a huge
learning curve for all of us. We ran into many issues where git was not working
the way we intended. Using the test-first development method for this assignment
worked very well for us, coding the test requirements and then writing the actual
code. A second issue that we ran into was trying to merge everyones Java files 
into one. Using the "git merge" command, we ran into the issue of everyone just 
replacing the java files in master and not merging them together.  

Throughout this entire project, we all were together in person working on it. 
There was a lot of communication the whole time trying to problem solve and reach
the final objectives in an effiect manner. Even though some team members may have
more pushes/commits than others, we all made equal contributions through the 
entire process from start to finish. 


Some more specifc contributions by each member:

Logan (11 hours)  - Coded the methods and test methods for both ADD and SUBTRACT. Helped fix 
			merging conflicts. 

Andy  (11 hours)  - Coded the methods and test methods for both DOT and NEGATE. Helped fix
			merging conflicts.

Ian   (11 hours)  - Coded the test methods for both testMAGNITUDE and testSCALE. Helped fix
			merging conflicts.

Joel  (11 horus)  - Coded the methods for both MAGNITUDE and SCALE. Took personal time to 
			sort out all version of java files and combine into one. 


During the entire project, we all were helping each other and looking over each
others code making sure we met all the requirements, especially making each method
immutable.
